# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited.

I accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/Vherus/mxtoolbox-php-api).


## Pull Requests

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the [README](README.md) and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Everything must have an associated unit test** - Please ensure everything has passing unit tests before committing

- **Create topic branches** - Don't ask me to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
