I accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/Vherus/mxtoolbox-php-api).


## Pull Requests

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the [README](README.md) and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Everything must have an associated unit test** - Please ensure everything has passing unit tests before committing.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.

- **I'm very particular** - Make sure your code is clean, documented, spaced appropriately and follows existing conventions.

- **This package is for PHP 7** - Unless absolutely necessary, ensure you have included all strict typing and return type hinting.
